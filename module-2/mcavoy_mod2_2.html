        <h2>Chapter 1 - The Author</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            <span class="sentence">Hi there!</span> My name is Carli McAvoy and I live in the western part of North
            Carolina. Although it is beautiful here, I can't help but miss my hometown in central Florida from time to
            time. Being close to the mountains is certainly a change from being close to the beach.
        </p>
        <p>
            I always tend to brag about my upbringing in Florida. Being so close to the beach, I can't even begin to
            list all the adventures I used to go on with my friends as a teenager. Not to mention Florida's beautiful
            natural springs, and of course, their famous amusement parks.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not thinking about what adventures I can go on next, I have a few hobbies that work as both
            creative and physical outlets when the world becomes too much to handle. I have always loved creating music,
            whether it's on the guitar, piano, or singing. When I hit a writer's block, I turn my attention to the
            beloved gaming consoles. I've also always been very active and find myself boxing, cycling, or hitting
            the gym when I've got extra energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I may sound like a bit of a free spirit, there is certainly nothing more important to me than my
            family, blood and chosen. It was my mother's decision to move that originally brought me to North Carolina.
            Me, my mother, and my sister have had a close relationship my entire life; I couldn't imagine a world
            without them at the forefront of it.
