        <p class="intro">
            <span class="sentence">Hi there!</span> My name is Carli McAvoy and I live in the western part of North
            Carolina. Although it is beautiful here, I can't help but miss my hometown in central
            <button type="button" onclick="buttonCallOne()"><span id = "stateOne">___</span></button>
            from time to time. Being close to the
            mountains is certainly a change from being close to the beach.
        </p>
        <p>
            I always tend to brag about my upbringing in <button type="button" onclick="buttonCallTwo()">
            <span id = "stateTwo">___</span></button>.
            Being so close to the beach, I can't even begin to list all the adventures I used to go on with my friends
            as a teenager. Not to mention Florida's beautiful natural springs, and of course, their famous amusement parks.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not thinking about what adventures I can go on next, I have a few hobbies that work as both
            creative and physical outlets when the world becomes too much to handle. I have always loved creating music,
            whether it's on the <button type="button" onclick="buttonCallThree()">
            <span id = "inst">___</span></button>, piano, or singing. When
            I hit a writer's block, I turn my attention to the beloved gaming consoles. I've also always been very
            active and find myself boxing, cycling, or hitting the gym when I've got extra energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I may sound like a bit of a free spirit, there is certainly nothing more important to me than my
            family, blood and chosen. It was my mother's decision to move that originally brought me to
            <button type="button" onclick="buttonCallFour()"><span id = "stateThree">___</span></button>.
            Me, my mother, and my sister have had a
            close relationship my entire life; I couldn't imagine a world without them at the forefront of it.
